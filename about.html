            <h3><span class="blue">SHARPE WEB DESIGNS</span></h3>
            <h1>Giving Small Businesses the Big Business Treatment</h1>
            <h3>My name is Brent S., I am the owner and sole developer of Sharpe Web Designs. 
                I got into programming after my wife had our first child. I was and still am a 
                stay-at-home dad, and I wanted a career that I can do from home and still be 
                there with the kids to watch them grow up. So over the course of two years I 
                taught myself how to code websites the right way by hand and just started calling 
                small businesses to offer my help.</h3>
            <h3>What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds to spend 
                thousands of dollars upfront on a new website. And the ones that did, got taken 
                advantage of and have a terrible website that looks like it was built by someone 
                in a dungeon and haven't seen design trends for the last 10 years. They were 
                in a frustrating spot - they either can't afford a good website, and if they can 
                they don't know who to trust to make something great. So I tweaked my business 
                model to fit their needs. That's how I came up with my $0 down and $150 a month 
                model. It's more managable for a small business to handle and won't hurt their 
                bank accounts.</h3>
            <h1><span class="blue">Quality</span> over Quantity</h1>
            <h3>We focus on the needs on each individual business and tailor content around what 
                makes it unique. Our collaborative process is very hands on as we work closely 
                with you to create a website you're 100% happy with and not something you just 
                settle for.</h3>
